Full Stack Open 2023
This repository contains my assignment submissions for Helsinki University Full Stack Open 2023 (https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

The course is on Modern JavaScript-based Web Development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

The course also contains additional sections for the following:

GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.
TypeScript, an open-source typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
React Native, an open-source UI software framework to create native mobile applications using JavaScript.
CI/CD, Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD)
Docker Containers, an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications by virtualizing the operating system of the computer on which it is installed and running.
